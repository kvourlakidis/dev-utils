Hello people of Earth!

My name is Kirill. 

Here is some food or thought. 
I often wonder whether you could have something like a 'simulation inception'. 
Imagine you run a simulation, trying to emulate the events in your environment as accurately as possible. 
At some point, after many iterations, your simulation will be sophisticated enough that it will resemble the properties and conditions of your environment to an indistinguishable degree of accuracy. 
After this happens, one might expect that an equivalent actor within the simulation, will create a simulation of their own, with the same aims of emulating its environment. This nested simulation will resemble the environment in the simulation, which resembles the environment in our world. 
You could imagine that this could keep going on forever, with inifite levels of nesting of simulated worlds, within simulated worlds. Is there some physical constraints that prevent this from happening? Is is actually possible to simulate the environment to an indistinguishable degree of accuracy? 
This kind of thinking reminds me of Jorge Luid Borges and Adolfo Casares' short story called 'On Exactitude in Science' from 1946. In it, an imaginary society becomes so apt at cartography, they create maps which are bigger and bigger in size, and more and more accurate in its detail. At some point they create a map, which has the same dimensions as the Kingdom it represents. At this point, the actors in the novel realise that their map is useless, as they can not derive any advantage from using it, for it is no different to not having the map at all. There is some interesting moral hidden in this, the heart of which I have not quite yet distilled from the rhetoric, but I will in due time. Ther is no point to rush these things. 

Food for thought,
