# Markdown Cheat Sheet

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax (Wikipedia). Github.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of features (guides.github.com).

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text. Do not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

Bold text is **surrounded by** double asterisks.

Italic text is surrounded by single asterisks.

Bold and italic text is surrounded by triple asterisks.

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> This is an example of a block quote. 
> 
> Each line of this blockquote is prefixed with a >.
> Other syntax elements *can be used inside* blockquotes.

Ordered lists are denoted by a number followed by a dot:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Unordered lists are denoted by dashes:
- An item
- Another item
- Yet another item

Links are declared inline or as a reference:

[Inline link](https://www.google.com)

[Link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's homepage")

[Reference link][Reference text]

[Relative file reference](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[Numbers can be used for reference links][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

Reference links:
[Reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Code blocks are either fenced by three back-ticks or indented with four spaces.
Only the fenced (back-tick) variant supports syntax highlighting.
