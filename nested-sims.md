# simulation-nesting

I often wonder whether nested simulations are paradoxical.

Imagine you run a simulation, trying to replicate the events in your environment as accurately as possible. 
At some point, after many iterations, your simulation will be sophisticated enough that it will resemble the properties and conditions of your environment to an indistinguishable degree of accuracy. 
After this happens, one might expect that an equivalent actor within the simulation, will create a simulation of their own, with the same aims of replicating his or her environment. This nested simulation will resemble the environment in the simulation, which resembles the environment in our world, and so on. 
One might imagine that is it possoble to go on like this forever, with inifite levels of nesting of simulated worlds, within simulated worlds. Is there some physical constraint that prevents this from happening? Is is actually possible to simulate the environment to an indistinguishable degree of accuracy? 

This thought experiment is related to Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Casares' short story called 'On Exactitude in Science' from 1946. In it, an imaginary society becomes so skilled at cartography, they create maps which are bigger and bigger in size, and more and more accurate in its detail. At some point they create a map, which has the same dimensions as the Kingdom it represents. At this point, the actors in the novel realise that their map is useless, as they can not derive any advantage from using it, for it is no different to not having the map at all.

Surely, there is some genius moral hidden in all this, though I cannot see it. 

More importantly, what is the difference between a simulation and an emulation, anyway?
